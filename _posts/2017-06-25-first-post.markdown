Testing the first post. I suppose later I'll probably include any major insights I have here.

At first, I was debating whether or not to go with Wordpress, Medium or some other kind of blog platform, but rather than choosing a platform, getting into the habit of writing something takes priority.

I've always needed an actual personal website on github, as a programmer, so this is a start.
